opnsense-arm64-raspberry-pi4
============================

This is the final release repo for a working opnsense arm64 release for Raspberry Pi4!

Whats happen here? 
=========================

This Branch will provide an easy way to get Opnsense on Raspberry PI4 ARM working!

Status: Build not finally running at the moment because Github Freebsd-VM Actions does not run at Arm64, so there will be an arm github runner required,
which will be finished soon
